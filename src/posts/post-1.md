I made this website using 11ty which is a static site generator. Referred to the [docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/). However, I am really struggling to get the dates right. There's some weird formatting issue with it not liking the custom filter in the `eleventy.config.js`, but we'll just hold off on it for now. It's also off by 1 and the fix to just apply `date.toUTCString()` works but it looks unwieldy.<br><br>

For now, I was able to apply all the CSS and fun HTML I learned the past 2 months. Some cool JavaScript was also used to display the dark mode switch. <br><br>

I've already deployed a website before so it wasn't too hard to deploy. I will continue to update the website and consider this my starter. <br><br>

Thanks for reading my first blog post!
